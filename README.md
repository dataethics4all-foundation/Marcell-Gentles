# Marcell-Gentles
Marcell Gentles' final project for DataEthics4All

The main goal of this project was to develop an AI-based tool that teenagers and young adults can use to analyze how potential employers view their social media activity and to improve their professional outlook by highlighting problematic posts. It ended up becoming a general Twitter setiment analysis tool because we did not have the resources to collect enough data specifically targeted toward that goal.

I used the Sentiment140 dataset. The originally used link is broken, but more information can be found at [this site](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kazanova/sentiment140).
